# LYNX Structured Data JSON Files

This repository contains structured data JSON files for all branches of LYNX. These files are used for implementing structured data on our website, specifically for the new option portal we are introducing.

## Introduction to Structured Data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. It's used by search engines in their search result to better understand what's on a page. Search engines read the structured data and use it to enhance the search result display, which can improve how your pages appear in search results.

Structured data is a critical aspect of SEO strategy as it makes your website's content more understandable and discoverable by search engines. This ultimately can improve your visibility and reach to your target audience.

## Purpose

The structured data JSON files in this repository are specifically built for the new option portal that LYNX is introducing on our website. The aim is to provide better context and understanding about the content on these portal pages, improving their performance in search engine results.
